    <h1>Welcome to René's boring website :)</h1>
    <h2>Why this boring webiste?</h2>
    <p class="text">This boring website is created by me to play with HTML and CSS coding, maybe even some Javascript, who knows!
    Obviously, don't expect to read or learn anything interesting here, you'd be disappointed. I have no idea what I will talk about, but who cares? I'll start with my previous and current motorbikes, that should give me something to play with.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="text">Luckily for you (as a reader) and me (as a writer), I only had two motorbikes in my life. No, actually I had three including my 125cc.

            <h3 class="biketitle"><a class="click" href="Zing/zing.html">Kymco Zinc 2</a></h3>
              <p class="text">Yep, my first bike, a 125cc that I bought in April 2016 after completing my CBT. Because that was after watching Sons of Anarchy on TV, I went for something that looked cool like a little Harley. Fun bike. More info on it <a class="click" href="Zing/zing.html">here</a>.

            <h3 class="biketitle"><a class="click" href="Hornet/hornet.html">Honda CB600F Hornet</a></h3>
              <p class="text">Well, as fun as the Kymco was, it was not meant to last (and it did not). The 125cc was a stepping stone to get a real bike. Hence after completing my CBT in February (or March?) 2016, I passed my full licence in February 2018 (before my CBT expired).
                Then the serious things started why I got a <a class="click" href="Hornet/hornet.html">Honda CB600F Hornet</a>. Damn how fun that was...

              <p class="text">As playful and enjoyable as the <a class="click" href="Hornet/hornet.html">Hornet</a> was, I soon realised that what I wanted was something made more for touring. Something that I could load up with my stuff for a weekend, and take the girlfriend on to go touring. Something a little bigger, with a bigger engine. Here came the <a class="click" href="cbf/cbf.html">Honda CBF1000</a>.
